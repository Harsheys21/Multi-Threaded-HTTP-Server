For this assignment. I ended up taking assignment 2 and assignment 3 and combined them to create a multi threaded server. One of the key components of this assignment is the use of flocks. With flocks, we're able to ensure the put is accessed one at a time while get can be accessed by multiple people. By enabling this method, we also prevent any thread conflicts. Additioanlly, this server has the feature to create mulitple threads which as a result can help with handling multiple clients. Overall, this assignment uses the helper functions given and uses the layout in the resources repo.
