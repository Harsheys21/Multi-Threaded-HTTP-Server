## Multi-Threaded Server Implementation README

### Overview

This implementation is a fusion of Assignment 2 and Assignment 3, resulting in the development of a robust multi-threaded server. A key highlight of this solution is the strategic utilization of file locks (flocks) to ensure exclusive access during 'put' operations, while 'get' operations are designed to be concurrently accessible by multiple clients. This approach minimizes the risk of thread conflicts, enhancing the overall reliability and performance of the server.

### Key Components

#### 1. File Locks (Flocks)

The incorporation of file locks plays a pivotal role in synchronizing access to the 'put' functionality. This mechanism guarantees that only one thread can execute a 'put' operation at a time, mitigating potential data corruption or inconsistency issues.

#### 2. Multi-Threading

The server is designed to spawn multiple threads, enhancing its capacity to efficiently handle concurrent client requests. The implementation leverages the inherent advantages of multi-threading to optimize resource utilization and responsiveness.

### Implementation Details

The implementation extensively utilizes the provided helper functions and follows the established layout in the resources repository. By adhering to this structure, the code maintains consistency and clarity, facilitating ease of understanding and future modifications.

### Usage Guidelines

To maximize the effectiveness of this multi-threaded server, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Flock Implementation:**
   - Ensure that the file locking mechanism is properly configured to maintain the integrity of 'put' operations.
   - Familiarize yourself with the specific implementation of flocks to adapt the code to any unique requirements.

2. **Multi-Threading:**
   - Leverage the multi-threaded architecture to efficiently handle concurrent client requests.
   - Monitor and adjust the number of threads based on system resources and performance benchmarks.

3. **Resource Repository Layout:**
   - Adhere to the predefined layout in the resources repository to facilitate code organization and readability.
   - Follow established conventions for code structure and documentation.

### Conclusion

This multi-threaded server implementation combines the strengths of Assignment 2 and Assignment 3, offering a resilient solution for concurrent client interactions. The strategic use of file locks and the ability to handle multiple threads contribute to a robust and efficient server, ensuring a seamless experience for users.
